<summary>Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis</summary>

In RTL design, the adherence to specifications is verified through simulation using a tool called a simulator. For this course, the simulator used is Icarus Verilog (Iverilog). The design refers to the actual Verilog code or set of codes that implement the intended functionality to meet the required specifications.

A testbench is used to apply stimulus, or test vectors, to the design to check its functionality. The simulator operates by monitoring changes in input signals; when an input changes, the corresponding output is evaluated. If there are no changes in the input, the output remains unchanged, as the simulator continuously checks for variations in input values to determine the resultant outputs.

Icarus Verilog (Iverilog) takes design files and testbench files as inputs. The output of Iverilog is a .vcd (Value Change Dump) file, an ASCII-based format generated by EDA logic simulation tools. This file records changes in signal values throughout the simulation. The .vcd file can then be used as an input for the GTKWave tool, which visualizes the waveforms of the design's signals. By viewing these waveforms, one can verify the correctness of signal transitions according to the stimulus provided by the testbench.

#### Commands used

The output will be a.out file for the simulation

## Introduction to Yosys RTL Synthesizer

Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It is used primarily for converting high-level Verilog descriptions of digital circuits into gate-level netlists that can be implemented on FPGAs or used for ASIC design. Yosys is highly versatile and supports various front-end and back-end tools, making it a valuable tool for digital design and synthesis.

Inputs for Yosys tool: Design (.v), Liberty (.lib)
Output: Netlist file (.net.v)

Verifying the design:

Use the Test bench using in RTL phase.Using the same stimulus used for RTL, the output expected should be the same as the one obtained in RTL phase.

### Synthesis

The process of transforming the RTL description into a lower-level representation consisting of gates and their interconnections. This process is typically performed using a synthesis tool, which maps the RTL code to a specific technology library containing various gate-level components like AND, OR, NOT gates, flip-flops, and more.

### What is .lib?

A .lib file, or a standard cell library file, is a collection of different standard cells that vary in functionality, input configurations, and other characteristics. These cells can implement various logic functions and are available in multiple performance models, such as slow, medium, and fast. Each model caters to different design requirements, providing options for trade-offs in speed, power, and area. This library enables designers to choose the appropriate cells to meet specific design criteria and constraints.

<summary>Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles</summary>


 A .lib file, also referred to as a Liberty file, is a standardized format in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. Library cell description contains a lot of information like timing information, power estimation, other several attributes like area, functionality, operating condition etc. Speaking more technically, liberty format is a format to represent timing and power properties of black boxes (which we cant descend into). Liberty is an ASCII format, usually represented in a text file with extension “.lib“.

### Key Elements of a .lib File:
**Timing Information:** Details about the delay and timing constraints of the cells.  
**Power Information:** Data on power consumption, including dynamic and leakage power.  
**Area Information:** The physical area occupied by the cells.  
**Operating Conditions:** Environmental parameters like temperature and voltage for which the cells are characterized.  
**Pin Descriptions:** Information about the input and output pins of the cells, including their functions and electrical properties.

In our lab, we utilize the **sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib file.** Here’s an explanation of the filename components:

**sky130:** Refers to the 130nm technology node provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry.  
**fd:** Stands for fully-depleted, indicating the type of process technology.  
**sc:** Stands for standard cell.  
**hd:** Stands for high-density standard cell library.  
**tt:** Typical process corner (typical-typical).  
**025C:** The temperature condition at which the library data is characterized (25°C).  
**1v80:** The operating voltage condition (1.8V).

### Hierarchial vs Flat Synthesis

#### Hierarchial Synthesis

In VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, hierarchical synthesis and flat synthesis are two approaches to synthesizing a digital circuit from a high-level description to a gate-level representation. They differ in how they manage and optimize the design hierarchy during the synthesis process.

**Hierarchical Synthesis**
**Definition:** Hierarchical synthesis, also known as module-based or top-down synthesis, involves preserving the design hierarchy throughout the synthesis process. The design is divided into modules or blocks, and each module is synthesized separately, maintaining its boundaries and interfaces.

Invoking yosys to synthesize example multiple_modules.v

<img width="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6e50452-0abb-45c0-854c-9ba1408140ab">

**1. Read the Liberty source file:**

yosys> read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib

__2.Read the Verilog source file:__

yosys> read_verilog multiple_modules.v

__3.Perform synthesis:__

yosys> synth -top multiple_modules

<img width="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e6516f4-ebae-4af7-b59b-67d2d0712052">

Here, Sub_module1 has one and gate, sub_module2 has one OR gate 

<img width="598" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7ce7c06-4561-49d3-b396-862a1b518790">

Top mdoule multiple_module has sub_module1 and sub_module2 of one instance each and totally it contains 2 cells of both AND and OR gate

<img width="602" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20e8c937-d28d-48ce-b583-9d7cc39cddd2">

**4.Technology Mapping to the Design using abc tool which is integrated with Yosys:**

yosys> abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib

<img width="611" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0aea456-40a4-4a7b-b4a1-2ec3fd5fe849">

**5.View the generated gate level netlist:**

yosys> show multiple_modules

<img width="602" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67cd5911-cc1a-4b8a-8e01-f815fa48745d">

Interestingly, the design is not displaying the AND and OR gates explicitly. Instead, it shows them as u1 and u2, which are instances of sub_module1 and sub_module2, respectively. Ideally, one would expect to see the AND and OR gates directly. This approach is known as hierarchical design, where the hierarchies are preserved, and the design maintains its modular structure.

**Flat synthesis:** Flat synthesis involves synthesizing the entire design as a single, monolithic entity without hierarchical organization.

**1.To flatten the design:**

yosys> flatten

<img width="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/328012d6-6823-42b2-abda-bbbb045abc43">

**2.To write a netlist to .v file:**

yosys> write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_flat.v

<img width="335" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17110aff-0dbf-4af3-9685-b76ba4b03bdc">

**3.To view the netlist (.v):**

yosys> !givim multiple_modules_flat.v

<img width="610" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f269f628-22e3-49fc-9c81-73618e5b3f0b">

<img width="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3db9bb-dc9c-49ab-9636-8757b60f9084">

In the first case, the hierarchies of submodule1 and submodule2 are preserved. In the second case, we see a single netlist where the hierarchies are flattened out, and we directly see the instantiation of the AND gate and OR gate under multiple modules.

**4.To view the flattened gate level netlist:**

yosys> show

<img width="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85119854-0c3f-4c1c-9123-17f55ae34b42">

So, when we flatten the design, we can see the structure completely.

### Sub module level synthesis###

Given multitiple modules, lets say we want to synthesize each sub module

**1.Read the Liberty source file:**

<img width="418" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/775dbb23-39d3-4ca3-bb98-0c86261e66cb">

**2.Read the Verilog source file:**

yosys> read_verilog multiple_modules.v

<img width="404" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/425116f0-c082-44e9-826e-8805e0c065fe">

**3.Perform synthesis:**

yosys> synth -top sub_module1

<img width="604" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb367283-2004-43ae-8734-4c2949a6c56c">

**4.Technology Mapping to the Design using abc tool which is integrated with Yosys:**

yosys> abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib

<img width="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f843ff7-ced0-4fd9-85a3-e348e95d5929">

**5.To view the generated gate level netlist:**

yosys> show

<img width="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e00d191e-5e48-48f6-a596-ed78ccefbb70">

Sub-module level synthesis is preferred:

1.When we have multiple instances of the same module  2. When the design is massive.

### Different Methods for Flip-Flop Coding and Performance Enhancement

**Why are flops necessary, and how do they mitigate glitches in the circuit?**

Glitches in digital circuits often arise due to signal delays, noise, or timing mismatches. Flops are essential in preventing these glitches by:

Synchronization: Flops are edge-triggered, responding only to specific transitions like clock edges, ensuring that output changes occur at precise moments, reducing the chance of glitches caused by transient signals.

Timing Control: Flops are driven by a clock signal, ensuring that all circuit operations are synchronized. This coordination prevents timing mismatches, which could otherwise lead to glitches when data arrives at different times.

So,Flip-Flops can be used to restrict glitch propagation as:

Flip-flops are edge triggered circuits,so the output changes on edge of the clock signal,so even if input of flops are glitchy,output remains stable.
Combinational circuits driven by the flops,will receive stable inputs,hence their glitches will eventually settle down.

<img width="740" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef17901d-53bd-48d0-b0f1-a877524954c1">

The value of the flop must be in a known state all the time,for this signals like reset or set are used to control the initial state . set and reset can be synchronous or asynchronous.

#### Flops and Flop coding styles

Combinational circuits can produce glitches while settling to a final value when cascaded. Flip-flops are essential to store these final values, allowing changes only when an external signal confirms that the combinational logic has stabilized. The output Q of the flip-flop is protected from changes at the input D until the appropriate timing signal is applied. Set/reset signals are used to initialize the flip-flop, ensuring that the initial output of Q is a known, stable value.

<img width="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a17e38da-f2e9-4665-b784-80e0db581b41">

<img width="604" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cb1918a-44ca-479b-85b1-4c0184a0fbb4">

Commands used:

1.iverilog dff_asyncres.v tb_dff_asyncres.v  2../a.out  3.gtkwave tb_dff_asyncres.vcd

<img width="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c5e04ae-0066-4cff-87ba-4562f5294f87">

<img width="604" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51829bfc-8061-45c6-bc0f-8f76e973d10e">

In the scenario described, when the reset signal goes low before the clock arrives and d is high, the output Q of the flip-flop does not immediately go to 1. Instead, it waits for the clock edge. This means that d is aligned with the clock, and the flip-flop only senses the value of d at the clock edge. The output q is therefore synchronized to the clock; d may change at any time, but q will only update when the clock edge occurs, ensuring that changes in q happen in sync with the clock when driven by d.
