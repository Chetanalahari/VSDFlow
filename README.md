<summary>Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis</summary>

In RTL design, the adherence to specifications is verified through simulation using a tool called a simulator. For this course, the simulator used is Icarus Verilog (Iverilog). The design refers to the actual Verilog code or set of codes that implement the intended functionality to meet the required specifications.

A testbench is used to apply stimulus, or test vectors, to the design to check its functionality. The simulator operates by monitoring changes in input signals; when an input changes, the corresponding output is evaluated. If there are no changes in the input, the output remains unchanged, as the simulator continuously checks for variations in input values to determine the resultant outputs.

Icarus Verilog (Iverilog) takes design files and testbench files as inputs. The output of Iverilog is a .vcd (Value Change Dump) file, an ASCII-based format generated by EDA logic simulation tools. This file records changes in signal values throughout the simulation. The .vcd file can then be used as an input for the GTKWave tool, which visualizes the waveforms of the design's signals. By viewing these waveforms, one can verify the correctness of signal transitions according to the stimulus provided by the testbench.

#### Commands used

The output will be a.out file for the simulation

## Introduction to Yosys RTL Synthesizer

Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It is used primarily for converting high-level Verilog descriptions of digital circuits into gate-level netlists that can be implemented on FPGAs or used for ASIC design. Yosys is highly versatile and supports various front-end and back-end tools, making it a valuable tool for digital design and synthesis.

Inputs for Yosys tool: Design (.v), Liberty (.lib)
Output: Netlist file (.net.v)

Verifying the design:

Use the Test bench using in RTL phase.Using the same stimulus used for RTL, the output expected should be the same as the one obtained in RTL phase.

### Synthesis

The process of transforming the RTL description into a lower-level representation consisting of gates and their interconnections. This process is typically performed using a synthesis tool, which maps the RTL code to a specific technology library containing various gate-level components like AND, OR, NOT gates, flip-flops, and more.

### What is .lib?

A .lib file, or a standard cell library file, is a collection of different standard cells that vary in functionality, input configurations, and other characteristics. These cells can implement various logic functions and are available in multiple performance models, such as slow, medium, and fast. Each model caters to different design requirements, providing options for trade-offs in speed, power, and area. This library enables designers to choose the appropriate cells to meet specific design criteria and constraints.

<summary>Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles</summary>


 A .lib file, also referred to as a Liberty file, is a standardized format in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. Library cell description contains a lot of information like timing information, power estimation, other several attributes like area, functionality, operating condition etc. Speaking more technically, liberty format is a format to represent timing and power properties of black boxes (which we cant descend into). Liberty is an ASCII format, usually represented in a text file with extension “.lib“.

### Key Elements of a .lib File:
**Timing Information:** Details about the delay and timing constraints of the cells.  
**Power Information:** Data on power consumption, including dynamic and leakage power.  
**Area Information:** The physical area occupied by the cells.  
**Operating Conditions:** Environmental parameters like temperature and voltage for which the cells are characterized.  
**Pin Descriptions:** Information about the input and output pins of the cells, including their functions and electrical properties.

In our lab, we utilize the **sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib file.** Here’s an explanation of the filename components:

**sky130:** Refers to the 130nm technology node provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry.  
**fd:** Stands for fully-depleted, indicating the type of process technology.  
**sc:** Stands for standard cell.  
**hd:** Stands for high-density standard cell library.  
**tt:** Typical process corner (typical-typical).  
**025C:** The temperature condition at which the library data is characterized (25°C).  
**1v80:** The operating voltage condition (1.8V).

### Hierarchial vs Flat Synthesis

#### Hierarchial Synthesis

In VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, hierarchical synthesis and flat synthesis are two approaches to synthesizing a digital circuit from a high-level description to a gate-level representation. They differ in how they manage and optimize the design hierarchy during the synthesis process.

**Hierarchical Synthesis**
**Definition:** Hierarchical synthesis, also known as module-based or top-down synthesis, involves preserving the design hierarchy throughout the synthesis process. The design is divided into modules or blocks, and each module is synthesized separately, maintaining its boundaries and interfaces.

Invoking yosys to synthesize example multiple_modules.v

<img width="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6e50452-0abb-45c0-854c-9ba1408140ab">

**1. Read the Liberty source file:**

yosys> read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib

__2.Read the Verilog source file:__

yosys> read_verilog multiple_modules.v

__3.Perform synthesis:__

yosys> synth -top multiple_modules

<img width="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e6516f4-ebae-4af7-b59b-67d2d0712052">

Here, Sub_module1 has one and gate, sub_module2 has one OR gate 

<img width="598" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7ce7c06-4561-49d3-b396-862a1b518790">

Top mdoule multiple_module has sub_module1 and sub_module2 of one instance each and totally it contains 2 cells of both AND and OR gate

<img width="602" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20e8c937-d28d-48ce-b583-9d7cc39cddd2">

**4.Technology Mapping to the Design using abc tool which is integrated with Yosys:**

yosys> abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib

<img width="611" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0aea456-40a4-4a7b-b4a1-2ec3fd5fe849">

**5.View the generated gate level netlist:**

yosys> show multiple_modules

<img width="602" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67cd5911-cc1a-4b8a-8e01-f815fa48745d">

Interestingly, the design is not displaying the AND and OR gates explicitly. Instead, it shows them as u1 and u2, which are instances of sub_module1 and sub_module2, respectively. Ideally, one would expect to see the AND and OR gates directly. This approach is known as hierarchical design, where the hierarchies are preserved, and the design maintains its modular structure.

**Flat synthesis:** Flat synthesis involves synthesizing the entire design as a single, monolithic entity without hierarchical organization.

**1.To flatten the design:**

yosys> flatten

<img width="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/328012d6-6823-42b2-abda-bbbb045abc43">

**2.To write a netlist to .v file:**

yosys> write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_flat.v

<img width="335" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17110aff-0dbf-4af3-9685-b76ba4b03bdc">

**3.To view the netlist (.v):**

yosys> !givim multiple_modules_flat.v

<img width="610" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f269f628-22e3-49fc-9c81-73618e5b3f0b">

<img width="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3db9bb-dc9c-49ab-9636-8757b60f9084">

In the first case, the hierarchies of submodule1 and submodule2 are preserved. In the second case, we see a single netlist where the hierarchies are flattened out, and we directly see the instantiation of the AND gate and OR gate under multiple modules.

**4.To view the flattened gate level netlist:**

yosys> show

<img width="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85119854-0c3f-4c1c-9123-17f55ae34b42">

So, when we flatten the design, we can see the structure completely.

### Sub module level synthesis###

Given multitiple modules, lets say we want to synthesize each sub module

**1.Read the Liberty source file:**

<img width="418" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/775dbb23-39d3-4ca3-bb98-0c86261e66cb">

**2.Read the Verilog source file:**

yosys> read_verilog multiple_modules.v

<img width="404" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/425116f0-c082-44e9-826e-8805e0c065fe">

**3.Perform synthesis:**

yosys> synth -top sub_module1

<img width="604" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb367283-2004-43ae-8734-4c2949a6c56c">

**4.Technology Mapping to the Design using abc tool which is integrated with Yosys:**

yosys> abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib

<img width="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f843ff7-ced0-4fd9-85a3-e348e95d5929">

**5.To view the generated gate level netlist:**

yosys> show

<img width="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e00d191e-5e48-48f6-a596-ed78ccefbb70">

Sub-module level synthesis is preferred:

1.When we have multiple instances of the same module  2. When the design is massive.

### Different Methods for Flip-Flop Coding and Performance Enhancement

**Why are flops necessary, and how do they mitigate glitches in the circuit?**

Glitches in digital circuits often arise due to signal delays, noise, or timing mismatches. Flops are essential in preventing these glitches by:

Synchronization: Flops are edge-triggered, responding only to specific transitions like clock edges, ensuring that output changes occur at precise moments, reducing the chance of glitches caused by transient signals.

Timing Control: Flops are driven by a clock signal, ensuring that all circuit operations are synchronized. This coordination prevents timing mismatches, which could otherwise lead to glitches when data arrives at different times.

So,Flip-Flops can be used to restrict glitch propagation as:

Flip-flops are edge triggered circuits,so the output changes on edge of the clock signal,so even if input of flops are glitchy,output remains stable.
Combinational circuits driven by the flops,will receive stable inputs,hence their glitches will eventually settle down.

<img width="740" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef17901d-53bd-48d0-b0f1-a877524954c1">

The value of the flop must be in a known state all the time,for this signals like reset or set are used to control the initial state . set and reset can be synchronous or asynchronous.

#### Flops and Flop coding styles

Combinational circuits can produce glitches while settling to a final value when cascaded. Flip-flops are essential to store these final values, allowing changes only when an external signal confirms that the combinational logic has stabilized. The output Q of the flip-flop is protected from changes at the input D until the appropriate timing signal is applied. Set/reset signals are used to initialize the flip-flop, ensuring that the initial output of Q is a known, stable value.

<img width="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a17e38da-f2e9-4665-b784-80e0db581b41">

<img width="604" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cb1918a-44ca-479b-85b1-4c0184a0fbb4">

Commands used:

1.iverilog dff_asyncres.v tb_dff_asyncres.v  2../a.out  3.gtkwave tb_dff_asyncres.vcd

<img width="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c5e04ae-0066-4cff-87ba-4562f5294f87">

<img width="604" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51829bfc-8061-45c6-bc0f-8f76e973d10e">

In the scenario described, when the reset signal goes low before the clock arrives and d is high, the output Q of the flip-flop does not immediately go to 1. Instead, it waits for the clock edge. This means that d is aligned with the clock, and the flip-flop only senses the value of d at the clock edge. The output q is therefore synchronized to the clock; d may change at any time, but q will only update when the clock edge occurs, ensuring that changes in q happen in sync with the clock when driven by d.

    <summary> Gate Level Simulation, Synthesis Simulation Mismatch, and Blocking & Non-Blocking Statements </summary>
 Gate-level simulation is a critical process in digital design, verification, and validation, especially for complex digital systems in modern technology nodes. It involves modeling digital circuits at the gate level to understand their behavior accurately. Gate-level simulation occurs after synthesis, providing a detailed netlist representation of the circuit with functional and timing characteristics. This simulation method is essential for dynamic behavior verification, complex timing checks, power efficiency concerns, and design-for-test features integrated at the gate level,ensuring the accuracy of scan chain insertions in DFT. Gate-level simulation is crucial for gaining confidence in design and verification, offering a more comprehensive analysis than static methods. It plays a pivotal role in validating, verifying, and optimizing digital circuits, making it a cornerstone of digital design.

In Gate level Simulation(GLS): Testbench used for RTL verification is used for netlist simulation,as they are logically same.

Why GLS?

Verify the correctness of the design after synthesis
Ensure the timing of the design is met which is done with delay annotation (timing aware)

Synthesis-Simulation mismatch occurs due to following reasons:

Missing sensitivity list

Blocking vs non-blocking assignments

Non-standard verilog coding

***1.Misiing Sensitivity list**

Missing Sensitivity List:

Simulator works when change in signals (activity) occurs,and output gets updated. If the sensitivity list of always block does not contain all input signals,it will cause mismatches between synthesis and simulation.

For ex: As seen in the screenshot below, in the left column,always block is evaluated only when sel is changing. So output y is not reflecting changes in input i1 and i0 when sel is not changing. Rather it acts like a latch. The code on the right side represents the correct design coding for mux. In this case always is evaluated for any signal changes.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64486d48-d514-4854-97b5-7f8ddf11b976)

As seen in the screenshot below,the code in left column is correct to achieve our aim of inferring two flip-flops but in code in right column,as q is getting directly assigned to d , hence only one flop is inferred. Hence,it is recommended to always use non-blocking statement in always block for sequential logic inference.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6292caf-9296-4ff5-9c02-ccced848e2fc)

For ex: In left column code,y will get old value of q0 during evaluation/simulation,which is mimicking the behavour of a flop. To get latest value of q0,we can interchange the statements in always block,as seen in right column code. Synthesis will produce the same logic implementation for both the codes. This will lead to synthesis-simulation mismatch.

No Activity on sel: When sel is low, i0 should be selected, but you are seeing no change in behavior. This indicates that the always block is not responding to changes in i0 or i1 when sel changes.

Multiplexer Acting Like a Flip-Flop: The behavior where only y is changing and not responding to i1 or sel signals properly is more like a flip-flop than a multiplexer. This is because the always @ (sel) sensitivity list limits the updates to y only when sel changes, which is incorrect for a combinational circuit like a multiplexer.

Why This is Happening:
The sensitivity list in your always @ (sel) block only watches for changes in sel. This means it ignores changes in i0 and i1, which explains why the multiplexer is not responding to changes in these inputs.

The non-blocking assignment (<=) is more suited for sequential logic (like flip-flops), not combinational logic. Non-blocking assignments introduce a delay, making the output update asynchronously, which is not ideal for this multiplexer.

<summary>Design for Test (DFT)</summary>


Introduction to Design for Test (DFT) :

Design for Test (DFT) is a crucial aspect of electronic system design that focuses on incorporating testability features into the hardware and software of a product. 
The primary goal of DFT is to ensure that the final product can be thoroughly tested, both during the manufacturing process and throughout its lifetime, to identify and address any defects or issues.

Key Principles of DFT :
* Accessibility: Designing the system in a way that allows easy access to internal components and signals for testing purposes.
* Controllability: Ensuring that the system can be driven into specific states or conditions to facilitate comprehensive testing.
* Observability: Enabling the observation and monitoring of internal signals and states during the testing process.
* Testability: Incorporating features that simplify the testing process, such as built-in self-test (BIST) mechanisms or scan chains.
  
Benefits of Implementing DFT :

* Improved Product Quality: DFT helps identify and address defects early in the design process, reducing the risk of shipping faulty products.
* Reduced Manufacturing Costs: Effective testing during manufacturing can catch issues before they become more expensive to fix, leading to cost savings.
* Faster Time-to-Market: By incorporating DFT principles, the testing process can be streamlined, allowing for quicker product development and deployment.
* Easier Maintenance and Troubleshooting: DFT features can aid in the diagnosis and repair of issues during the product's lifetime, improving overall reliability and serviceability.

DFT Techniques and Methodologies :

Some common DFT techniques and methodologies include:
* Scan-based Testing: Inserting scan chains to allow for the controllability and observability of internal logic.
* Built-in Self-Test (BIST): Incorporating self-testing capabilities directly into the hardware or software.
* Boundary Scan (IEEE 1149.1): Using a standard interface to access and control the pins of integrated circuits for testing purposes.
* Design for Testability (DFT) Automation: Leveraging EDA tools to automate the incorporation of DFT features during the design process.



Basic Terminologies to be known about DFT:

**Defect** - A defect in an electronic system is the unintended difference between the implemented hardware and its intended design.

Some typical defects in VLSI chips are :
1. Process Defects – missing contact windows, parasitic transistors, oxide breakdown,etc.
2. Material Defects – bulk defects (cracks, crystal imperfections), surface impurities,etc.
3. Age Defects – dielectric breakdown, electromigration, etc.
4. Package Defects – contact degradation, seal leaks, etc.

**Error** - A wrong output signal produced by a defective system is called an error. An error is an “effect” whose cause is some “defect”.

**Fault** - A representation of a “defect” at the abstracted function level is called a fault.

**Controllabilty** - From DFT point of view,Controllability means the ease of both '0' and '1' being able to propagate to each and every node within the target patterns.
                     A point is said to be controllable if both '0' and '1' can be propagated through scan patterns.

<img width="576" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b438b9a-ed9d-4ec4-8e0e-1a24c2e9b9fe">

**Observabilty** - By observability, we mean our ability to measure the state of a logic signal. When we say that a node is observable, we mean that the value at the node can be shifted out through scan patterns                    and can be observed through scan out ports.

<img width="556" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b93add16-54ef-48f9-9c45-e3f7bc521a37">

**Fault Coverage** - Percentage of the total number of logical faults that can be tested using a given test set T.

**Defect Level** - It refers to the fraction of shipped parts that are defective or the proportion of the faulty chip in which fault is not detected and has been classified as good.

DFT Techniques :

Ad-hoc Techniques : 

The adhoc DFT relies on “good” design practices learned from experience. Some of these are:

• **Avoid asynchronous logic feedbacks.** A feedback in the combinational logic can
give rise to oscillation for certain inputs. This makes the circuit difficult to
verify and impossible to generate tests for by automatic programs. This is
because test generation algorithms are only known for acyclic combinational
circuits.

• **Make flip-flops initializable.** This is easily done by supplying clear or reset
signals that are controllable from primary inputs.

• **Avoid gates with a large number of fan-in signals.** Large fan-in makes the
inputs of the gate difficult to observe and makes the gate output difficult to
control.

• **Provide test control for difficult-to-control signals.** Signals such as those produced
by long counters require many clock cycles to control and hence increase
the length of the test sequence. Long test sequences are harder to generate.

Structured DFT :

* Structured DFT is performed by using Scan flip-flops.

* The main idea in scan design is to obtain control and observability for flip-flops.

* This is done by adding a test mode to the circuit such that when the circuit is in this mode, all flip-flops functionally form one or more shift registers. 

* The inputs and outputs of these shift registers (also known as scan registers) are made into primary inputs and primary outputs. 

* Thus, using the test mode, all flip-flops can be set to any desired states by shifting those logic states into the shift register. 

* Similarly, the states of flip-flops are observed by shifting the contents of the scan register out. All flip-flops can be set or observed in a time (in terms of clock periods) that equals the
number of flip-flops in the longest scan register.

**What is the purpose of scan flops?**

There are various reasons, but 2 main reasons are noted below:

* To test stuck-at faults in the manufactured devices.
* To test the path in the manufactured devices for delay that is to test whether each path is working at a functional frequency or not.

Types of Scan flip-flops:

1) Multiplexed Scan cell :

3) Clocked Scan cell:

   <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0fb4bed-b954-44c4-ad32-7fcc15130a8c">

4) LSSD Scan cell:

   <img width="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c9513c5-b6e0-4edd-81b8-6c42cf0f787f">

Scan chain : A scan chain is a serial interconnection of scan flip-flops within a digital circuit. It forms a shift register-like structure that enables the sequential access and manipulation of the internal states of flip-flops in the circuit for testing and debugging purposes.

Here's how a scan chain works:

* Interconnection: In the scan chain, each scan flip-flop is connected to the next one in the chain, forming a serial path that traverses through all the flip-flops within the circuit.
* Shift-In/Shift-Out: The scan chain allows for the serial shifting of data into and out of the flip-flops. Test patterns can be shifted into the chain to set the initial states of the flip-flops for testing. 
                      Similarly, the current states of the flip-flops can be serially shifted out for observation or comparison.
* Test Patterns: Test patterns generated by automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) tools or other testing methods can be applied to the scan chain to detect faults within the circuit, such as stuck-at faults, 
                 transition faults, and bridging faults.

**How long one scan chain be?**
The length of a scan chain in a digital circuit can vary depending on several factors, including the design requirements, the complexity of the circuit, and practical limitations imposed by the technology and implementation.

In theory, there is no strict limit to the length of a scan chain, and it can span hundreds or even thousands of flip-flops in a very large integrated circuit. However, longer scan chains can present challenges in terms of testing speed, power consumption, and signal integrity.

Here are some considerations regarding the length of a scan chain:

* Testing Speed: As the length of the scan chain increases, the time required to shift in or shift out test patterns also increases. Longer scan chains can result in longer test times, which may be undesirable for production testing or design validation.
* Power Consumption: Each flip-flop in the scan chain consumes power during shifting operations. Longer scan chains may result in higher power consumption, which can be a concern in low-power designs or battery-operated devices.
* Signal Integrity: In longer scan chains, signal integrity issues such as propagation delay, skew, and crosstalk become more significant. Proper design techniques, such as buffer insertion and routing optimizations, may be necessary to mitigate these issues.
* Design Constraints: Practical limitations imposed by the technology and implementation may restrict the length of a scan chain. For example, limitations in routing resources, timing constraints, or the available space on the integrated circuit may impose constraints on the maximum achievable scan chain length.

**No. of scan ports(scan_in and scan_out) required = 2 * no. of scan chains.** because each scan chain requires its' own scan_in & scan_out port

Note:

**Number of cycles required to run a pattern = Length of longest scan chain**

<img width="629" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/598d9f75-eccc-4e4b-8697-6349f4877060">

**Why do we use ATPG?**
* Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) is utilized in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) to ensure the correctness and quality of Integrated Circuits (ICs).
* ATPG is essential because it automates the process of generating test patterns that can detect faults in the circuit, making it cost-effective, time-saving, and crucial for the design and testing phase of VLSI 
  circuits.
* The complexity of VLSI circuits, with millions of transistors on a single chip, makes manual testing impractical.

**What is ATE?**

* Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is computerized machinery that automates the testing of electronic devices and systems, evaluating functionality, performance, quality, and stress tests. ATE uses test instruments to carry out these evaluations with minimal human interaction, ensuring adequate performance and safety of electronic devices. 
* The components of an ATE system typically include hardware, software, test instruments, signal sources, and test probes or handlers. 
* Industries use ATE extensively, including defense and aerospace, automotive, and industrial automation, to validate electronics before deployment or sale. ATE plays a crucial role in ensuring end-users receive 
  devices that function as intended and are safe to use.

**When and where the DFT design is included?**

* When is it included? - At the beginning of the  design flow

* Where exactly ? - during the synthesis flow

**Why Different Flavors of gate are required?**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6e4a6d4-3078-42e1-b960-b92c93c46dcd)

* Different flavors of gate are required because the delay of combo logic between flops determines maximum speed of operation (clock frequency) of our design.
* Smaller the combinational delay,larger can be the clock frequency,which can be achieved by using faster cells.
* But, we also need to meet our hold time requirement for flops,so that data should not come within the hold window of a flop.Here the need arises for slower cells.
* Hence,both faster and slower cells are used to meet our target clock frequency while avoiding hold time violations in our design.
* These cells collectively form our std. cell library and their timing and logical information is used by tools,in the form of .lib format.

**DC Synthesis Flow**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6319eca1-9ab7-4201-accc-a29d3271d5cc)

#### Lab 1 - Invoking DC Basic Setup :

git clone the repository 

Commands to invoke DC are :

csh # to invoke c shell

dc_shell # to invoke DC tool

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0c3eaf0-d466-4da0-b289-ebee942f0953)

target_library - It specifies the library of std. cells for a particular technology to be used by DC tool during technology mapping and optimization phase of synthesis.

link_library - It contains the set of design entities,i.e,any std. cell,PLL,SRAM,Analog IPs which are directly instantiated in RTL,and is used by DC tool to resolve these references.These entities are not used 
               during technology mapping phase.

* When we echo the target_library and link_library variables in dc_shell we see they are pointing to `your_library.db` and `* your_library.db` respectively,which are non-existent imaginary libraries.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b82b4f91-9b0b-4c53-b316-ded2775b1d80)

**Read the design**

read_verilog verilog_files/lab1_flop_with_en.v - Command used to reads design information from Verilog files into memory. It does the work of both analyze and elaborate command in single step.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25e7495f-2d4e-45a7-92ce-92ab5de29683)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d86e7377-2d90-43ad-966c-2886443b6661)

**Write the design**

RTL for lab1_net.v

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/147d5ec5-ebc3-492f-9427-096a34bc1a2d)

After writing out the netlist, we can observe in above screenshot,that the tool has currently synthesized our design using generic technology independent cells,which are part of GTECH library of DC to produce the netlist.

To understand our design, DC has some virtual libraries called GTECH libraries.

To get a proper technology mapped netlist,we need to specify our technology library for the target_library and link_library variables.

**Read the design after specifying library**

It is still writing in the GTECH format only. we need to set two variables 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2287d9d-3042-4fd2-9dd7-34e10da9373d)

It is still pointing out the your library.db and this need to be corrected

#### Lab 2 - Intro to ddc gui with design_vision :

`.ddc` - .ddc consists of the same information as a .db file. ddc is a synopsys encrypted form of our design which can be read by the tools such as Design compiler, IC compiler and prime time. It consists of the netlist(list of components and nets) information of our design , .db libraries (target and link) used, along with the constraints which we have specified for implementing the design.

**What is Design Vision?**

* The Design Vision tool is the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Synopsys logic synthesis environment. 
* Design Vision provides analysis tools for viewing and analyzing your design at the generic technology (GTECH) level and the gate level. 
* It also provides all of the synthesis capabilities of the Design Compiler tool. Design Vision provides menu commands and dialog boxes for the most commonly used synthesis features. 
* In addition, we can enter any dc_shell command on the command line in the GUI or the shell.

Commands to generate .ddc file and read it in design vision tool:

      After Synthesis has been performed using DC shell,
      write -f ddc -out lab1_net_with_sky130.ddc # writes out .ddc file for current design
      exit dc shell and enable C Shell with the command csh
      design_vision # invokes design vision tool , invoke after exiting DC shell or in new terminal window/tab
      read_ddc lab1_net_with_sky130.ddc # read the design information for the specified .ddc file

 #### Lab 3 - dc synopsys setup :

 1.csh

 2.dc_shell

 3.echo $target_library (shows your non-existant virtual library)

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/068dd1ec-c3aa-47d3-9853-c9fe152ec0f7)

 4.echo $link_library

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6450c8-c1fe-488c-9500-1971c6dca5bb)

 5.set target_library DC_WORKSHOP/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.db 

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1371bf72-b4f4-4964-bb0b-8db089fbf169)

 6.set link_library {*target_library}

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10695cea-a8a0-4e59-9fc9-08d00ac1c5ba)

 * When we have design with multiple .db libraries , it is very cumbersome & error-prone to set target_library and lInk_library manually, as we cannot miss even one .db library
* So to solve the above issue, all repetitive tasks ( setting target and link libraries) which is essential for tool setup can be put in a single file ,called `.synopsys_dc.setup`.
* `.synopsys_dc.setup` can be present in two locations
    * First,in DC tool install directory which is the default one to be picked by DC tool
    * Second, can be created in user home directory,and which when present will be read by DC tool for setup instead of the default one present in its' install directory.

 **Creating manually in home directory**

1.pwd

 2.gvim .synopsys_dc.setup( Save the file in the home directory)

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/667eabf7-9413-4e7e-9f9e-5102e73bc208)

 3. Invoke dc_shell and give the command echo $target_library. It is set properly.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/706212e8-dbe2-42e8-976d-4e5187630d31)

If the file .synopsys_dc.setup is either moved from home directory or its' name is altered in any manner, it will not be read by dc_shell when the tool is being invoked.

  <summary> TCL Scripting Lab</summary>

TCL (Tool Command Language) is extensively used for writing SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints) files, which are essential for defining the design intent and constraints during synthesis and physical design. Additionally, all the internal commands within Design Compiler (DC) and other Synopsys tools are written and executed using TCL. This allows for greater flexibility and automation in design processes, making TCL a fundamental scripting language for EDA tools and workflows in the VLSI industry.
