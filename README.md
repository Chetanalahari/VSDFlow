<summary>Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis</summary>

In RTL design, the adherence to specifications is verified through simulation using a tool called a simulator. For this course, the simulator used is Icarus Verilog (Iverilog). The design refers to the actual Verilog code or set of codes that implement the intended functionality to meet the required specifications.

A testbench is used to apply stimulus, or test vectors, to the design to check its functionality. The simulator operates by monitoring changes in input signals; when an input changes, the corresponding output is evaluated. If there are no changes in the input, the output remains unchanged, as the simulator continuously checks for variations in input values to determine the resultant outputs.

Icarus Verilog (Iverilog) takes design files and testbench files as inputs. The output of Iverilog is a .vcd (Value Change Dump) file, an ASCII-based format generated by EDA logic simulation tools. This file records changes in signal values throughout the simulation. The .vcd file can then be used as an input for the GTKWave tool, which visualizes the waveforms of the design's signals. By viewing these waveforms, one can verify the correctness of signal transitions according to the stimulus provided by the testbench.

#### Commands used

The output will be a.out file for the simulation

To view the simulation results, use a waveform viewer like GTKWave. Open the GTKWave and load the generated VCD file:

## Introduction to Yosys RTL Synthesizer

Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It is used primarily for converting high-level Verilog descriptions of digital circuits into gate-level netlists that can be implemented on FPGAs or used for ASIC design. Yosys is highly versatile and supports various front-end and back-end tools, making it a valuable tool for digital design and synthesis.

Inputs for Yosys tool: Design (.v), Liberty (.lib)
Output: Netlist file (.net.v)

Verifying the design:

Use the Test bench using in RTL phase.Using the same stimulus used for RTL, the output expected should be the same as the one obtained in RTL phase.

### Synthesis

The process of transforming the RTL description into a lower-level representation consisting of gates and their interconnections. This process is typically performed using a synthesis tool, which maps the RTL code to a specific technology library containing various gate-level components like AND, OR, NOT gates, flip-flops, and more.

### What is .lib?

A .lib file, or a standard cell library file, is a collection of different standard cells that vary in functionality, input configurations, and other characteristics. These cells can implement various logic functions and are available in multiple performance models, such as slow, medium, and fast. Each model caters to different design requirements, providing options for trade-offs in speed, power, and area. This library enables designers to choose the appropriate cells to meet specific design criteria and constraints.

<summary>Day 2 - Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles</summary>

 A .lib file, also referred to as a Liberty file, is a standardized format in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. Library cell description contains a lot of information like timing information, power estimation, other several attributes like area, functionality, operating condition etc. Speaking more technically, liberty format is a format to represent timing and power properties of black boxes (which we cant descend into). Liberty is an ASCII format, usually represented in a text file with extension “.lib“.

### Key Elements of a .lib File:
**Timing Information:** Details about the delay and timing constraints of the cells.  
**Power Information:** Data on power consumption, including dynamic and leakage power.  
**Area Information:** The physical area occupied by the cells.  
**Operating Conditions:** Environmental parameters like temperature and voltage for which the cells are characterized.  
**Pin Descriptions:** Information about the input and output pins of the cells, including their functions and electrical properties.

In our lab, we utilize the **sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib file.** Here’s an explanation of the filename components:

**sky130:** Refers to the 130nm technology node provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry.  
**fd:** Stands for fully-depleted, indicating the type of process technology.  
**sc:** Stands for standard cell.  
**hd:** Stands for high-density standard cell library.  
**tt:** Typical process corner (typical-typical).  
**025C:** The temperature condition at which the library data is characterized (25°C).  
**1v80:** The operating voltage condition (1.8V).

Comparison of the area occupied by 2-input AND gates with varying drive strengths or widths shows that gates with higher drive strengths or greater widths occupy more area and will have less delay.
